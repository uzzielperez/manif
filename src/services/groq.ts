      Now, let's focus on your intention to ${prompt}.
      
      Visualize yourself already having achieved this desire. How does it feel? What does it look like?
      
      The universe is abundant and supports your dreams. Every cell in your body is aligned with this intention.
      
      As you breathe, feel the energy of manifestation flowing through you.
      
      You are deserving of this manifestation. You are worthy of your desires.
      
      See it clearly in your mind's eye. Feel the emotions of having already received what you desire.
      
      Trust in the process. Trust in the timing of the universe.
      
      Your manifestation is on its way to you now. It is already yours.
      
      Take another deep breath and feel gratitude for what is coming to you.
      
      You are a powerful creator. Your thoughts become things.
      
      When you're ready, slowly open your eyes, carrying this energy of manifestation with you throughout your day.
