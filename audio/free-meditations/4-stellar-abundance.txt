Close your eyes... and take a deep breath in... feeling the air fill your lungs... and then exhale slowly... allowing any tension to release... 
As you breathe out... imagine any thoughts or worries leaving your body... like clouds drifting away from a sunny sky... 
Allow yourself to settle into this present moment... feeling the weight of your seat on the ground... the sensation of the air on your skin... 
Take another breath in... and as you inhale... imagine fresh energy entering your body... filling you with a sense of calm and clarity... 

Now... imagine yourself standing on a hill... under a vast starry night sky... the stars twinkling like diamonds above you... 
Feel the vastness of the universe... the infinite possibilities that exist... and the abundance that surrounds you... 
As you gaze up at the stars... allow yourself to connect with the cosmic energy... the infinite potential that resides within you... 
Take a moment to breathe in this energy... feeling it fill your heart... and expand your awareness... 

Imagine a bright light beginning to emanate from the center of your being... a warm, golden glow that radiates outward... 
As this light grows... it fills your entire body... nourishing your cells... and awakening your inner wisdom... 
Allow this light to shine brighter... illuminating your path... and guiding you toward your deepest desires... 
Take a breath in... and as you exhale... imagine any doubts or fears dissolving... like mist evaporating in the morning sun... 

Now... bring to mind something you wish to manifest in your life... a dream or desire that feels meaningful to you... 
Take a moment to envision this desire in vivid detail... seeing it as if it already exists... 
Feel the emotions that arise when you imagine this desire fulfilled... the joy... the excitement... the sense of fulfillment... 
Allow these emotions to fill your heart... and radiate outward... like ripples on a peaceful lake... 

As you continue to breathe... imagine the universe responding to your desire... the infinite abundance of the cosmos flowing toward you... 
Envision this abundance taking the form of your desired outcome... manifesting in your life with ease and grace... 
Feel the sense of trust and faith that arises when you know that the universe is supporting you... 
Take a deep breath in... and as you exhale... repeat the phrase to yourself... I am open to receiving the abundance of the universe... 

Remember... the universe is always working in your favor... guiding you toward your highest good... 
Trust that your desires are on their way to you... and that the universe is providing everything you need... 
Take a moment to feel the sense of peace and trust that arises when you align with the infinite abundance of the universe... 
Allow this feeling to settle deep within you... like a gentle rain nourishing the earth... 

As you come to the end of this meditation... take a deep breath in... and when you are ready... slowly open your eyes... 
Remember to carry this sense of cosmic abundance with you... throughout your day... and into your life... 
Take one final breath in... and when you exhale... imagine yourself grounded and centered... ready to manifest your desires... and live a life filled with purpose and abundance...
