Close your eyes... and take a deep breath in... feeling the air fill your lungs... and then exhale slowly... allowing any tension to release... as you breathe out... 
Let your body relax... starting at the crown of your head... and working its way down... to your toes... allowing each muscle to release... and let go... of any stress or anxiety... as you exhale... 
Imagine yourself standing on a peaceful planet... surrounded by a vast expanse of stars... and galaxies... stretching out before you... like a canvas of twinkling lights... in the darkness of space... 
Feel the ground beneath your feet... solid and stable... connecting you to the earth... and the universe... as you breathe in... the fresh air... and the calmness of the cosmos... 

Now... bring your attention to your heart center... and imagine a warm... loving light... beginning to glow... like a star igniting... in the darkness... this light represents loving kindness... and compassion... 
As you inhale... imagine this light growing brighter... and more intense... filling your entire being... with a sense of warmth... and kindness... towards yourself... and all beings... 
Repeat the phrase to yourself... may I be happy... may I be healthy... may I be at peace... allowing the words to sink deeply... into your heart... and mind... 
Take a moment to feel the kindness... and compassion... that you are cultivating... towards yourself... and allow it to fill your entire being... 

Now... expand your circle of kindness... to include those around you... friends... family... and loved ones... imagine them standing before you... and repeat the phrase... may you be happy... may you be healthy... may you be at peace... 
As you say these words... imagine a wave of loving kindness... flowing from your heart... to theirs... filling them with warmth... and compassion... 
Take a deep breath in... and as you exhale... imagine this wave of kindness... spreading out... to all beings... everywhere... may all beings be happy... may all beings be healthy... may all beings be at peace... 
Allow this feeling of kindness... and compassion... to fill your entire being... and radiate outwards... like ripples on a pond... 

Imagine the cosmos... as a vast web of interconnectedness... with every star... and galaxy... connected to every other... and to you... 
As you inhale... imagine the light of loving kindness... flowing in... from all directions... and filling your being... 
And as you exhale... imagine this light... flowing out... to all corners of the universe... may the entire cosmos... be filled with loving kindness... and compassion... 
Take a moment to feel the oneness... and interconnectedness... of all beings... and the universe... 
Allow yourself to rest... in this feeling of unity... and kindness... for as long as you like... 

As you come to the end of this meditation... take a deep breath in... and when you are ready... slowly open your eyes... 
Take a moment to notice how you are feeling... and carry this sense of loving kindness... and compassion... with you... throughout your day... 
And remember... that you can return to this feeling... whenever you need it... by simply closing your eyes... and cultivating loving kindness... towards yourself... and all beings... 
Take one final breath in... and when you are ready... slowly return to your day... with a sense of peace... and compassion... guiding you...
