Close your eyes... and take a deep breath in... feeling the air fill your lungs... and then exhale slowly... allowing any tension to release... as you breathe out... 

Imagine yourself standing on a planet... surrounded by the vastness of space... with stars and galaxies stretching out before you... like diamonds scattered across the velvet blackness... the universe is full of wonder... and mystery... and you are a part of it... connected to all that exists... 

Take a moment to feel the ground beneath your feet... the weight of your body... the sensation of the air on your skin... and as you breathe in... imagine that you are inhaling the cosmos... filling yourself with the beauty and magic of the universe... allowing it to expand your heart... and fill you with a sense of awe... and gratitude... 

As you stand there... surrounded by the stars... consider the incredible gift of life... the intricate web of relationships... that binds us all together... the earth that supports us... the sun that nourishes us... the air that we breathe... and the water that quenches our thirst... feel a sense of appreciation... for the simplicity... and the complexity... of existence... 

Now... bring to mind... the people in your life... who have touched your heart... who have supported you... who have loved you... and as you think of each one... feel a sense of gratitude... for the role they play... in your journey... for the lessons they have taught you... and for the love they have shared... allow your heart to fill with appreciation... and warmth... 

As you continue to breathe... imagine that you are surrounded by a soft... golden light... that represents the energy of gratitude... it fills your body... and radiates outward... connecting you to all that is... in the universe... feel this light... expanding your heart... and filling you with a sense of oneness... with all that exists... 

Take a moment... to reflect on the beauty... of the natural world... the majesty of the mountains... the serenity of the oceans... the beauty of the sunsets... and the wonder of the night sky... feel a sense of gratitude... for the gift of this planet... and all its inhabitants... and for the opportunity... to experience it all... 

As you stand in the vastness of space... surrounded by the stars... and the galaxies... consider the infinite possibilities... that exist... the unexplored territories... of the universe... and the mysteries that lie within... feel a sense of wonder... and awe... at the sheer magnitude... of creation... and the magic that it holds... 

Now... take a deep breath in... and as you exhale... imagine that you are releasing... any thoughts... or feelings... that no longer serve you... allowing yourself to let go... of anything that weighs you down... and simply be... in this moment... surrounded by the cosmos... and filled with gratitude... 

As you come to the end of this meditation... take a moment... to notice how you feel... notice the sensation of your body... the state of your mind... and the fullness of your heart... and when you are ready... slowly open your eyes... and return to your day... carrying with you... the sense of cosmic gratitude... and the knowledge... that you are a part of something much larger... than yourself...
