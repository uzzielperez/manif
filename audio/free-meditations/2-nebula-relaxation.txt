Close your eyes... and take a deep breath in... feeling the air fill your lungs... and then exhale... slowly... allowing any tension to release... as you breathe out... 
Allow your body to settle... into the present moment... feeling the weight of your seat on the ground... the sensation of the air on your skin... 
Imagine yourself floating... in a vast, starry universe... surrounded by twinkling lights... and colorful nebulas... drifting gently... through the cosmos... 

As you float... allow your body to relax... starting at the crown of your head... feeling any tension or stress... melt away... like ice dissolving in the warmth of the sun... 
Move down... through your face... your jaw... your neck... and your shoulders... releasing any held tension... as you exhale... 
Allow your arms to feel heavy... and relaxed... sinking into the sensation... of weightlessness... as you drift through the nebulas... 

Imagine a soft, pink nebula... surrounding your body... filling you with a sense of calm... and tranquility... as you breathe in... the gentle, soothing energy... of this cosmic cloud... 
Feel your heart rate slowing... your mind quieting... as you become one with the universe... 
Allow yourself to let go... of any thoughts or worries... like leaves drifting away... on a gentle stream... 

As you continue to float... imagine a blue nebula... approaching you... its soothing, gentle light... enveloping your body... calming your mind... and soothing your spirit... 
Feel the cool, calming energy... of this nebula... as it wraps around you... like a soft, comforting blanket... 
Allow yourself to sink deeper... into relaxation... as you breathe in... the peacefulness of this cosmic moment... 

Now, imagine a vibrant, purple nebula... bursting with creativity... and inspiration... 
As you breathe in... the energy of this nebula... feel your mind expanding... your imagination soaring... like a star exploding in the vastness of space... 
But as you exhale... allow any thoughts or ideas... to gently drift away... like clouds disappearing in the morning sun... 
Remember, you are not here to think... or create... but to simply be... in this peaceful, cosmic moment... 

As you continue to drift... through the nebulas... allow yourself to let go... of any remaining tension... or stress... like a leaf falling from a tree... 
Feel your body becoming heavier... more relaxed... as you sink into the sensation... of deep relaxation... 
Imagine yourself surrounded... by a warm, golden light... filling you with a sense of peace... and tranquility... as you breathe in... the soothing energy... of this cosmic embrace... 

As you rest... in this peaceful state... allow yourself to become aware... of your breath... the sensation of the air moving in... and out of your body... 
Feel the rise and fall... of your chest... the sensation of your belly expanding... and contracting... as you breathe... 
Allow yourself to simply be... in this moment... without thought... or distraction... 

As you slowly come back... to awareness... take a deep breath in... and when you are ready... slowly open your eyes... 
Remember the sense of peace... and tranquility... you felt during this meditation... and carry it with you... into your day... or into your rest... allowing yourself to drift off... into a deep and peaceful sleep...
