Close your eyes... and take a deep breath in... feeling the air move into your body... and then exhale... slowly... allowing any tension to release... as you breathe out... 

Imagine yourself standing on a hill... at dawn... as the sun begins to rise... the sky is painted with hues of pink and orange... a gentle warmth on your skin... the sun's rays peeking over the horizon... slowly... illuminating the world... 

As you inhale... imagine you are drawing in the sun's energy... like a breath of fresh air... filling your lungs... and then your entire body... with a warm, golden light... that spreads... and expands... throughout your being... 

Now, bring your attention to your breath... feel the sensation of the air moving in... and out... of your body... the rise and fall of your chest... or the sensation of the breath in your nostrils... as you inhale... imagine you are breathing in the sun's rays... and as you exhale... imagine any doubts or worries... leaving your body... like clouds drifting away... 

As you continue to breathe... imagine the sun's energy... building inside you... like a gentle fire... that warms your heart... and illuminates your mind... with clarity... and purpose... the warmth spreading... to your fingers... and toes... filling your entire body... with a sense of vitality... and well-being... 

Now, visualize the sun's rays... entering the crown of your head... and flowing down... through your body... like a river of light... nourishing your cells... and rejuvenating your spirit... as the light travels... it fills any areas of tension... or stress... with calmness... and peace... 

As you exhale... imagine any areas of darkness... or uncertainty... being released... like autumn leaves... drifting to the ground... and as you inhale... imagine the sun's energy... filling the spaces... with warmth... and light... 

Take a moment... to notice how your body feels... any sensations... or areas of relaxation... allow yourself to sink deeper... into the calmness... and serenity... of this moment... 

Imagine the sun's energy... now expanding... beyond your body... filling the space around you... like a warm, golden aura... that protects... and guides you... as you navigate... the world... 

As you continue to breathe... imagine the sun's rays... connecting you... to the universe... to the stars... and the planets... to the infinite expanse... of space and time... you are a part of... something much larger... than yourself... 

Now, bring your attention... to your heart center... and imagine a bright, shining sun... at the core of your being... radiating love... and compassion... to all beings... and to the world... 

As you inhale... imagine you are breathing in... the love... and the light... of the universe... and as you exhale... imagine any fears... or doubts... being released... like ripples... on a peaceful lake... 

Take a few more breaths... and allow yourself... to settle deeper... into the calmness... and the serenity... of this moment... feeling the sun's energy... still resonating... within you... 

When you are ready... slowly... open your eyes... and take a deep breath in... feeling refreshed... renewed... and invigorated... by the power of the solar energy breath...
