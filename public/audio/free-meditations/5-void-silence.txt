Close your eyes... and allow your body to relax... feel the weight of your seat on the ground... the sensation of your feet touching the floor... 
take a deep breath in... and as you exhale... allow any tension to release... let go of any thoughts or worries... 
simply be present in this moment... in the stillness of your own being... 

Imagine yourself floating in the vastness of space... surrounded by the darkness of the cosmos... the stars twinkling like diamonds against the blackness... 
feel the infinite silence of the universe... the quietness that pervades all of existence... 
allow yourself to become one with this silence... to merge with the emptiness of space... 
let go of all boundaries... all limitations... and simply be... 

As you drift deeper into the void... you begin to notice the subtle vibrations of the universe... the hum of creation... 
it's a gentle resonance... a soothing melody that underlies all of existence... 
listen to this sound... allow it to fill your being... to vibrate through every cell of your body... 
feel the harmony of the universe... the balance and the peace that lies at its core... 

Now... imagine a beam of light... shining down upon you... from the depths of the cosmos... 
this light represents the infinite wisdom of the universe... the guidance and the support that is always available to you... 
allow this light to fill your heart... to illuminate your mind... and to nourish your soul... 
feel its warmth... its comfort... and its peace... 

As you bask in the radiance of this light... you begin to realize that you are not separate from the universe... 
you are a part of it... a thread in the intricate tapestry of existence... 
feel the interconnectedness of all things... the oneness that binds us together... 
allow this sense of unity to fill your being... to expand your awareness... and to deepen your understanding... 

In the silence of the void... you find the stillness of your own heart... 
a place of profound peace... a sense of calm that transcends all worries and fears... 
allow yourself to rest in this peace... to let go of all resistance... and simply be... 
feel the gentle rhythm of your breath... the rise and fall of your chest... 
and the quietness that lies at the core of your being... 

As you continue to float in the vastness of space... you begin to notice the impermanence of all things... 
the fleeting nature of life... the ever-changing landscape of the universe... 
allow this awareness to fill your being... to remind you of the preciousness of each moment... 
and the importance of living in the present... 
feel the freedom that comes from letting go... the release of all attachments... and the simplicity of being... 

In the depths of the void... you find the infinite potential of the universe... 
a place of endless possibility... a sense of wonder that inspires and uplifts... 
allow yourself to tap into this potential... to feel the excitement of discovery... 
and the joy of exploration... 
feel the sense of awe that comes from contemplating the mysteries of the cosmos... 
and the humility that arises from recognizing your place within the grand scheme... 

As you slowly begin to return to your body... take a deep breath in... and as you exhale... 
allow any remaining tension to release... feel the weight of your seat on the ground... 
the sensation of your feet touching the floor... 
and the gentle rhythm of your breath... 
take a moment to notice how you feel... 
before slowly opening your eyes... and returning to your day... 
with a sense of peace... and a deeper connection to the universe...
