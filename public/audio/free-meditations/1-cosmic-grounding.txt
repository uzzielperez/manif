Close your eyes... and take a deep breath in... feeling the air move into your body... and then exhale... allowing any tension to release... as you settle into this present moment... 

Imagine yourself standing on a vast, open plain... with the sky above you... stretching out in every direction... a brilliant blue during the day... or a canvas of twinkling stars at night... the earth beneath your feet... solid and stable... supporting your weight... as you breathe in... feel the energy of the earth rising up... through the soles of your feet... 

As you inhale... envision fresh, cosmic air filling your lungs... carrying with it the essence of distant stars... and the wisdom of the universe... and as you exhale... imagine any doubts or worries... leaving your body... like clouds drifting lazily across the sky... disappearing into the distance... without a trace... 

Now... bring your attention to your feet... feeling the weight... the connection to the ground... the sensation of the earth's energy... rising up... through your legs... and into your body... as you breathe in... imagine roots growing from the soles of your feet... deep into the earth... anchoring you... stabilizing you... 

... and as these roots grow... they begin to glow... with a soft, gentle light... a light that represents your connection to the earth... and to the cosmos... this light begins to fill your entire body... nourishing you... calming you... as you continue to breathe... deeply... slowly... 

Imagine this light... expanding... filling any spaces... where you may have felt uncertain... or ungrounded... bringing a sense of stability... and presence... to your entire being... as you inhale... feel this cosmic energy... supporting you... guiding you... 

... and now... envision a brilliant, shimmering light... above your head... a light that represents the infinite possibilities... of the universe... this light begins to flow down... into your body... filling you with a sense of wonder... and awe... as you breathe in... feel this energy... expanding your consciousness... 

As you continue to breathe... deeply... slowly... imagine yourself... becoming one... with the earth... and the cosmos... feeling the stability... of the ground beneath you... and the infinite possibilities... of the universe above you... 

... and in this moment... you are grounded... and connected... to all that is... you are a part of... the vast, cosmic web... of life... and energy... and you are at peace... 

Take a moment... to notice how you feel... right now... in this present moment... without judgment... simply observing... your breath... your body... your connection to the earth... and the cosmos... 

... and when you are ready... slowly... gently... begin to bring your attention back... to your physical body... taking a deep breath in... and out... and when you open your eyes... you will feel... more grounded... more connected... to the earth... and the universe... 

Take one final... deep breath in... and as you exhale... imagine yourself... carrying this sense of connection... and stability... with you... throughout your day... and into your life...
